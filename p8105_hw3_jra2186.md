```

## Problem 1

1.  How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

``` r
#How many isles are there?
instacart %>%
  pull("aisle") %>%
  unique() %>%
  length()
```

    ## [1] 134

``` r
#Which aisles are the most items ordered from?
instacart %>%
  pull("aisle") %>%
  janitor::tabyl() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head(10) #Top 10 aisles by number of items ordered
```

    ##                              .      n    percent
    ##               fresh vegetables 150609 0.10877304

    ##                          bread  23635 0.01706970

2.  Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>%
  pull("aisle") %>%
  janitor::tabyl() %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(.,n) , y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "Number of items ordered",
       x = "Aisle",
       title = "Aisles with more than 10,000 ordered items")
```

3.  Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c(
    "baking ingredients",
    "dog food care",
    "packaged vegetables fruits"
  )) %>%
  select(aisle, product_name) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = aisle,
              values_from = product_name,
              values_fn = length) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 3
    ##   packaged_vegetables_fruits baking_ingredients dog_food_care
    ##                        <int>              <int>         <int>
    ## 1                      78493              13088          1612

``` r
  #select(baking_ingredients, dog_food_care, packaged_vegetables_fruits)
  # group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%
  # tally(sort = TRUE)
```

4.  Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

## Problem 2

1.  Clean the data.

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
brfss <- brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  #pull(response) %>% unique() -- We have responses from "Excellent" to "Poor"
  mutate(
    response = factor(response,
       levels = c("Poor",
                  "Fair",
                  "Good",
                  "Very good",
                  "Excellent")
      )
    )
```

2.  In 2002, which states were represented at 7 or more locations?

``` r
brfss %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  pull(locationdesc) %>% unique()
```

  # janitor::tabyl(locationabbr) %>% pull(n) %>% sum()
```

3.  Construct a dataset that is limited to “Excellent” responses and
    contains year, state, and a variable that averages the `data_value`
    across locations. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over
    time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for each
    state across years – the `geom_line` geometry and `group` aesthetic
    will help).

``` r
brfss %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(locationabbr, year) %>%
  summarise(mean_data_value = mean(data_value)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_data_value, group = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line() #Not the most useful plot
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'locationabbr'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

    ## Warning: Removed 3 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path).

4.  Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
    distribution of `data_value` for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”)
    among locations in NY State

``` r
brfss %>%
  filter(locationabbr == "NY", year %in% c(2006,2010)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(.~year)
```
